# Security Policy

## Security boundary

ANCAP aims to be open-source where transparency increases trust, integration, and adoption.

However, the following remain private and must never be published in public issues, PRs, docs, or examples:
- private keys
- seed phrases / mnemonics
- bridge signer logic and operational controls
- admin wallets
- production `.env` values
- deploy secrets and tokens
- real RPC / API credentials
- hot-wallet operational internals
- sensitive anti-fraud thresholds that would materially help abuse

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues responsibly.

Preferred report contents:
- affected component
- impact
- reproduction steps
- proof-of-concept if safe
- suggested mitigation if known

Until a dedicated security email exists, open a **private security advisory** in GitHub if available for the repository owner, or contact the maintainer through a private channel instead of a public issue.

## Disclosure policy

- Do not publish exploit details before the issue is triaged and mitigated.
- Give maintainers time to reproduce and patch.
- If a secret may have leaked, assume compromise and rotate/revoke it immediately.

## Scope examples

In scope:
- auth bypass
- privilege escalation
- secret exposure
- insecure defaults in production paths
- unsafe wallet / bridge / receipt handling
- chain settlement integrity issues
- injection / SSRF / unsafe deserialization / RCE risks

Out of scope unless there is a concrete exploitable path:
- generic best-practice suggestions without a demonstrated project-specific weakness
- purely theoretical attacks with no plausible exploit chain

## Hard rule

Never commit real secrets to the repository. If you discover one, stop and rotate/revoke it first.
